\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Project Overview and Statement of Proposal}
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a technique that a program can use to 
parse individual or stream images into a matched set of some written alphabet; 
often just a set of alphanumeric characters. 
OCR is used in banking, note taking applications,
 and many other services used on a daily basis. 
One of the most common implementations of OCR is the use of neural networks, 
often through supervised learning methods. 
We propose to create a simple neural network that will be trained and tested 
to classify a single image into an alphanumeric character 
using one such supervised learning technique. 
In the process of developing the neural network, 
we'll develop a host of tools to test and 
view the networks created and some performance metrics to gauge effectiveness.

\subsection{Project Scope and Objectives}
The initial scope of the project, as outlined in the overview, will be to create a simple Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system using a neural network and employ supervised learning techniques to test and train our model. Our main objectives for the project include:
\begin{enumerate}[(a.)]
  \item Build the components of neural network using object-oriented design principles and programming language (like Java).
  \item A training and test environment for our neural network.
  \item A graphical user interface (GUI) that the user can draw characters
    for the model to classify them.
  \item A graphical user interface (GUI) to view the created neural networks to
    visually see how each model works.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Discussion of Risks to Be Managed}
The risk to be managed for this project will primarily involve managing the technical complexity,
and dealing with public-facing risks like product size or customer relations. The risks for 
this project require mitigation measures that attempt to alleviate technical risks. For example,
one mitigation effort requires unit testing to help ensure the behavior of each component
of the neural network is functioning as expected.

\subsection{Risk Mitigation, Monitoring, and Management Plan}
\subsubsection{Risk Mitigation}
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
  \item \textbf{No Robust Testing Method to Evaluate the Whole Neural Network - Process Risk:}

  It's very difficult to evaluate how a neural network is flawed, since it's connections
  are often elaborate and difficult to understand (the black box effect). Instead, to help mitigate this risk we propose to introduce unit testing inside the components, and test smaller version
  of the models we will ultimately create.

  \item \textbf{Inexperience in Neural Networks - Staff Risk:}

  If this risk becomes a problem, our mitigation efforts involve
  holding meetings to review relevant information about neural networks. 
  Writing unit tests should also help, since they help the writer understand
  how each component is supposed to function

  \item \textbf{Team Members Use a Variety Different Hardware and Software 
  - Development Environment Risk:}
  
 If different hardware and software environments poses a risk, we can use a virtual machine
 to create a single development environment.
 
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Risk Monitoring}
Risk monitoring involves gauging understanding of each component of the project, ensure
that each part is properly understood and that tests are written properly to ensure each component
is working as intended and understood by members of the project.

\subsubsection{Risk Management (Contingency Plans)}
Contingency plans to reduce risk involve creating and utilizing many different
neural network performance metrics, like hamming distances and F1 scores, the ensure
the accuracy of our model and the soundness of our training process. If we encounter
issues implementing the supervised learning process, we can try other techniques instead.

\subsection{Hardware and Software Resources}
We plan to create our project using Java, version 22. 
To help automate our build and deployment processes, we are using Gradle. 
In order to facilitate version control, we use GitHub with Jira to keep track of our 
development process and task management. Each team member uses different 
code editors, depending on their preferences.

\subsection{Special Resources}
The only possible special resource we may need for the project is a Virtual Machine 
to manage the running and building of the final project, since it will be hosted online.
